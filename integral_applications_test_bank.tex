\question 

Let $f(x) = \sin(x)$ and consider the region bounded between $f$ and the $x$-axis between $x=0$ and $x=\pi$.  What is the volume of the solid given by rotating this region about the $y$-axis? [SHOW ALL YOUR WORK.]



\question  Assume we can apply the Mean Value Theorem to the function f.  Also, assume the average rate of change of $f$ on the interval $[a,b]$ is 14.  Then which of the following statements is true according to the Mean Value Theorem?

\begin{choices}  % correct: C
\choice The derivative of $f$ equals 14;
\choice There is a point $x^*$ in the interval where $f'(x^*) = f(b)-f(a)$;
\choice There is a point in the interval where the derivative equals the average rate of change; %correct
\choice There is a point $x^*$ in the interval where $f'(x^*) = \frac{14}{b-a}$;

\choice Right in the middle, at $x=\frac{a+b}{2}$, the derivative equals 14.

\question \label{pyr1} Consider a pyramid with a square base.  The base has length 5 meters on each side.  The pyramid is 3 meters tall.  Put coordinates on the pyramid as in the image below.
